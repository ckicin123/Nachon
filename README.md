a card game I made cuz I learnt about classes. It's not simply attack and defend, each card has their own special move (i made this 3 years after actually uploading it to github)

this game requires 2 users to have access to the same terminal, or one user to input what the other asks. 

at the start of the game you will be given a deck of cards.
players will one at a time pick out cards from this deck until the deck is empty, these are the cards each player has to play with.
