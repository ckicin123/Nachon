# Nachon
a card game I made cuz I learnt about classes. It's not simply attack and defend, each card has their own special move (i made this 3 years after actually uploading it to github)

this game requires 2 users to have access to the same terminal, or one user to input what the other asks. (game runs in terminal)

# gameplay

at the start of the game you will be given a deck of cards.
players will one at a time pick out cards from this deck until the deck is empty, these are the cards each player has to play with.

card selection will look like this

```
player 1 pick a card:

nightfury
firewall
cheater charles
rooster ron
ankle breaker
camo cat
: nightfury
player 2 pick a card:

firewall
cheater charles
rooster ron
ankle breaker
camo cat
: firewall
player 1 pick a card:

cheater charles
rooster ron
ankle breaker
camo cat
: 
```

after the choosing of cards you'll be able to view what each card does and their stats before the game actually starts

this game uses turn based combat

note that each card has health, defense, attack and a special

health is as it is in every other game, cards take damage, if the card hit 0 or less the card dies and the card is lost

when it's a player's turn, they can either choose to attack, defend or use a special.

### attacking
when attacking the player must pick a card they have to attack with and an enemy card to attack.
if a card on the opponent's side is put in defense, the player is forced to attack that card and that card will have their defense stat decreased by the damage done.
if more damage is done than the defense stat, the extra damage goes toward decreasing the health.
### defending
on a player's turn they can choose to put a card in defense.
this card only comes off of defense once the opponent attacks, no matter how many turns go by until then.
### specials
each card has it's own special ability, you can see what each one is in their descriptions. 
they are a one time use and you can use it on your turn.
